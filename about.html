<h1> About Me !</h1>
Hello, my name is Paola Herrera. I am from Caracas, Venezuela. I move to United States 5 years ago. The first thing I did was studying English at Nova Southeastern University. Then, I went to Broward College and got my degree as an Accounting Specialist. After getting my degree I worked as a Manager of Porsche Design Store locates in Aventura Mall. I was doing something I did not like much, so I started studying again and now I am getting closer to get my Advertising Degree from Miami International University of Art & Design
